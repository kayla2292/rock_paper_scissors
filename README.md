# rock_paper_scissors
week 2 python project (rock, paper, scissors)

Everyone: We all took turns coding in VS Code. Honestly a very team-based approach we all brainstormed together, and walked through each concept together and why. Evenly split workload between members for both coding and design brainstorm.
